# ASCII Art
One of the [project](https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/12/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-ascii-art/)s from the "Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners " series by Robert Heaton.

<p style="text-align: center;">"An advanced beginner is someone who has learned a lot but doesnâ€™t know what to do next."</p>

Each project in is "semi-guided", effectively dividing the final objective into small, manageable milestones. This approach ensures that learners are sufficiently challenged yet receive enough clues to prevent them from reaching a dead end -- all while requiring them to implement the majority of the complex tasks independently.

**This is my personal take on the project, and I have plans to eventually add more to it.**
